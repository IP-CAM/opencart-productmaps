Description:
----------------------------------
	This module makes it possible to add a map to a product. It creates a separate tab on
	product edit page where a location can be added. This adds a tab called "Map" to the
	product page as well as a "Directions" button. Customers can check the map and enter
	their address to get directions to the location shown on map. Map size and zoom level
	can be configured via backend.


Installation:
----------------------------------
	1. If you don't have vQmod installed, install it first. vQmod is 
	   _required_ for this module to work. You can get it at http://vqmod.com/
	   It needs to be installed and functional. 
 
	2. Copy the files and folders from the upload/ directory to your OpenCart installation.

    3. Install the module via Backend -> Extensions -> Modules -> Product Maps.
	
	   NOTE: This step is mandatory since it creates the table that holds maps.


If you are using a custom theme:
----------------------------------
	1. Modify the line in file vqmod/xml/productmaps.xml that 
		<file name="catalog/view/theme/default/template/product/product.tpl">
	   and replace "default" with your theme's folder name, e.g.
		<file name="catalog/view/theme/YOURTHEME/template/product/product.tpl">

	2. This extension may not work with heavily modified custom themes out of the box 
	   since it relies on specific lines of code found in the default theme. If those
	   are removed in your theme, extension will not work out of the box. If it's your
	   case, contact me and I'll do my best to help you.

Usage:
----------------------------------
    1. Add Google Maps location via Edit Product -> Map screen in backend.

    2. Map and directions button will appear on product screen in a separate tab.
